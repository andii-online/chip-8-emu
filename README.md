# CHIP-8 emulator
![Demo of Emulator](chip-8.gif)

This application was built in the Rust language, using SDL2 bindings to handle window creation, rendering, keyboard input, and sounds.

If you're interested in trying out emulation for yourself and don't know where to start, [Tobias V. Langhoff's](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/) guide was a resource I used heavily during this project.

# Installation
